# Arduino DIY IIDX Controller
*(Deepseek used)*  
An IIDX controller inspired by lizardbeans' work, using a design similar to the Overclock A case. Compatible with LR2, beatoraja, and official Konami games. Features include HID lighting support. Total build cost is approximately Â¥300-400 (excluding some tools), varying based on component choices. Delivers excellent performance at an affordable price.

## Current Features
1.  **Functional PCB:** Includes schematic, PCB layout, and Gerber files (in `PCB&BOM` folder). Manufactured via JLCPCB.
2.  **Enclosure CAD Files:** Full acrylic case + turntable. Includes an optional turntable version with coupling flange support (skip cutting if unused).
3.  **Multi-Mode Firmware:** Detailed functionality below.

## Controller Modes
Hold **START** (BTA on PCB) + **one button (1-6)** while plugging in USB to select mode. Modes are stored in EEPROM and reloaded on subsequent connections.

    *   **Connector Orientation:** Tab facing **UP**
    *   **Left 2 Pins:** Microswitch connections
    *   **Right 2 Pins:** LED connections
*   **Encoder:** Wired similarly (refer to diagram)
*   **USB:** Features reversible Type-C port (recommended to use an extension cable)

## Enclosure Design
*   **Material:** Laser-cut acrylic
*   **Frame:** 10mm thickness
*   **Panels:** Thickness specified in CAD files
*   **Assembly:** Connect top/bottom panels using **50mm M4 standoffs** inserted into screw holes
*   **Turntable Options:**
    1.  **D-shaft Mount:** Relies solely on encoder's D-shaped shaft. Provides good feel if cut accurately. *Controller cannot be inverted*
    2.  **Coupling Flange Mount:** Requires optional flange. **Potential shimming needed:** Encoder height may require adjustment (spacers/washers) to prevent turntable from floating
*   **CAD Features:** Includes anti-splinter chamfers and countersunk screw holes. Ready for laser cutting services
